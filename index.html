        <p>On a fateful day, a ship carrying noblemen including Alonso, Antonio, and Gonzalo was wrecked upon the mysterious island governed by Prospero. The survivors' tales are both harrowing and inspiring. We had the chance to interview one of the survivors, who shared their experience with us.</p>
        <p><em>Interview excerpt:</em></p>
        <p>'The storm came out of nowhere,' said Gonzalo. 'One moment the sea was calm, and the next, our ship was being tossed about like a toy. We were sure we wouldn't survive.'</p>
        <p>The survivors describe their initial fear and confusion, followed by their relief at finding themselves alive, albeit stranded on a strange island. They speak of encountering the island's inhabitants, including the enigmatic Prospero, his daughter Miranda, and the rebellious Caliban.</p>
        <p>Despite the challenges, the survivors' spirit of resilience shines through their stories. Their accounts give us a glimpse into their struggle for survival and their interactions with the island's magical elements.</p>
